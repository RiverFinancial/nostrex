# Nostrex

Nostrex is a Nostr relay written in Elixir. It is designed to be highly scalable and very operator-friendly to empower the rapid adoption of the Nostr protocol. Nostrex has a number of qualities and features that make it a compelling relay implementation.

### Concurrency

The Erlang OTP gives us the primitives necessary to build high-throughput, concurrent high-uptime message routing software. The OTP has been hardened and optimized over decades and a single beefy server should be able to handle millions of concurrent connections.

### Database optimization

One of the major bottlenecks of scaling a relay are the database operations. Nostrex has already implemented a number of optimizations at the DB level, including partitioning by Event `created_at` timestamps to keep table sizes in check.

### Fast Filtering

Nostrex takes full advantage of the Erlang OTP's ETS in-memory datastore as the global state for a fast-filtering algorithm that efficiently matches events to filters instead of brute-forcing and checking each new event against every registered filter. There is still a lot of room to improve this algo.

### Solid Foundation

The Erlang OTP allowed Whatsapp to scale to billions of users with a small team of engineers. With the right optimizations I feel confident that a single beefy Nostr instance will be able to power millions of concurrent connections.

### Rate limiting

IP-based rate limiting for sockets, filters, and events is implemented and configurable.

### Load testing

Load testing tooling is located in the `/load_testing` repo.
